This repository consists of all the projects' code of the tasks given during my internship at Codsoft.

## Multi-Functional Web and AI Projects

### Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

**Description:**
Experience the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in your web browser! This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing version of the game. Players can compete against each other, and the game dynamically updates the board to indicate the winner or a draw. Dive into the world of web development with this engaging project.
